# Smart-Gym-Android

This project aims at developing an Android application devoted to gym customers who desire a full access to the services offered by gym facility's owners.
The implementation is highly linked to a centralized back-end software, which provides data for populating the contents of the app with real customer's information stored into a remote database.

## Features

This app allows users to:

  - Log in with existent credentials
  - Sign up to start experiencing the provided services
  - Visualize customer's exercises list and individual tasks, helping the user throughout the whole training path
  - Communicate with gym trainers by means of a real-time Firebase chat
  - Consult and modify customer's profile page, keeping track of progress and current health status
  - Be informed about gym news and discounts thanks to a notification mechanism
